# lichess-api
A Rust client for [v2.0.0 of the lichess.org API](https://lichess.org/api)

## Status ðŸš§

This crate is currently under construction and testing, and should therefore be considered unstable for the time being.
Many of the main endpoints have been implemented and tested, but more required work is in progress. 

There are four goals for this crate:
- Support the minimum endpoints required for implementing a lichess bot.
- Support all lichess api endpoints.
- Make a major version release once all endpoints are supported and considered reliable.
- Keep dependencies up to date and continue to support any future updates to the lichess api.
